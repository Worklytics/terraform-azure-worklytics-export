# Basic Worklytics Export to Azure Blob Storage Example

We don't recommend *direct* use of this example, but rather use it as a reference for how to add
the Worklytics Export module to your own Terraform configuration or as a working example when
developing the module itself.

## Usage for Development

Within `examples/basic/` (eg, here), create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following content,
customizing Azure Tenant ID and Worklytics Tenant ID as needed.

```hcl
worklytics_tenant_id = "123456712345671234567"
azure_tenant_id = "aaaa8888-4444-5555-6666-777777777777"
resource_group_name = "my-resource-group-name"
storage_account_name = "my-storage-account-name"
resource_name_prefix = "my-worklytics-data-export-resources-" # Optional
```

Then test the example:

```shell
terraform init
terraform apply
```
